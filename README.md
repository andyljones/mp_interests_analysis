An ongoing project to convert the information in the [MP's register of financial interests](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmregmem/contents1415.htm) to a useful format, and then to do something useful with it.
 
 - Installation and usage instructions will appear when it can *actually do* something useful. Right now this is a public repository simply because I'd have to pay for a private one.
